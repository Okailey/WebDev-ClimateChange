  <h3 id = "About" > WHAT IS SOCIAL JUSTICE AND WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?</h3>
<div class =" social  ">
  <p> Social justice today is a justice in terms of the distribution of wealth, opportunities, and privileges within a society. 
    Today, many lives are being destroyed due to the increasing bias of technology and human activities to destroy the earth's ozone layer. </p>

    <p>Social justice and climate change are two interconnected issues that are increasingly gaining attention around the world. Climate change affects everyone, but its impacts are felt most acutely by the world's most vulnerable populations. This includes low-income communities, people of color, and indigenous communities, who are often disproportionately impacted by the consequences of climate change, such as rising sea levels, more frequent and severe natural disasters, and reduced access to resources like food and water. </p>
 
  <p>In order to achieve social justice, societies must work to identify and eliminate systemic injustices that prevent certain groups of people from enjoying the same opportunities and privileges as others. This might involve addressing issues such as poverty, discrimination, racism, sexism, and inequality, and implementing policies and programs that promote equality and fairness.</p>

  <p>Social justice ensures fairness and equality. Social justice ensures that all individuals are treated fairly and equally, regardless of their background or circumstances. This means that everyone has access to the same basic human rights and opportunities, such as education, healthcare, and employment.
    <p>
<p> Social justice seeks to address systemic injustices and biases that perpetuate inequality and discrimination. By working to eliminate these barriers, we can create a more equal and just society that benefits everyone.
Social justice celebrates diversity and recognizes the value of different perspectives and experiences. It promotes inclusion and encourages individuals to embrace their unique identities and cultures.
There is a sense of shared responsibility and collective action. By working together to address issues of inequality and injustice, we can build stronger, more cohesive communities.</p>

    <br>
   WHO IS SUFFERING? </h4>
    <br>
<div class = "climate ">

  <p>It is known that over the years, the ozone layer has been depleted tremendously by human activities. 
    <br>
    In recent years, the climate patterns have changed in the sense that it does not snow as much as its supposed to. It rains at unexpected times and the the seasons have changed. <br>
    <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4H1N_yXBiA">Watch this </a>
  </p>

   <p>  Climate change may specifically impact people who live in areas that are prone to coastal storms, drought, and sea level rise. Those who live in poverty and rely heavily on the climate for agriculture also suffer immensely now due to the change in rain patterns or the scarcity of it. Similarly, some professions like farmers and fishermen as well as certain industries may face considerable challenges from climate change.<br>

        <p>  
  <br>
           <br>

  <p>Over the last few years, climate change has become a critical issue of concern for people and governments around the world. Scientists warn that the impacts of climate change could be irreversible if we do not take significant action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition to a more sustainable way of life.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the root causes of climate change are often tied to systemic issues of economic inequality and environmental degradation. For example, the burning of fossil fuels that contributes to climate change is often driven by industries that prioritize profit over environmental and social concerns, leading to the exploitation of workers and the degradation of ecosystems.</p>

<p>Climate change refers to the long-term changes in the Earth's climate, including changes in temperature, precipitation, and weather patterns. These changes are primarily caused by human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, which release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and trap heat, leading to a warming of the planet.</p>

<p>The consequences of climate change are far-reaching and can have significant impacts on both natural and human systems. This includes rising sea levels, more frequent and severe natural disasters, shifts in ecosystems, and changes in weather patterns that can affect agriculture and water availability.</p>

<p> Imagine farmers wanting rain and for their crops and there is no rain. How would people who live close to the ocean survive if the water level rises and threatens to destroy their homes. If people keep cutting down trees to bulid homes and do not replant, it would increase the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Illegal farming methods also contribute to this. We need to help the world! We need to be able to manage how we utilize the natural environment and most importantly how to keep it. </p>
